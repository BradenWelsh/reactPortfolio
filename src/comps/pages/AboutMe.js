                My name is Braden Welsh, I am currently 19 years old, born April 20, 2002. I currently work at Wal-Mart and am a part time student at Trilogy Coding Bootcamp through UT Austin working my way towards getting a certificate to become a Full-Stack Web Developer.
                I took 1 year of computer science in High School and learned a little bit of Java. I made games like Asteroids, Pong, Cookie Clicker, Rock Paper Scissors, and more easy games like that. In the future I am hoping to be a Full-Stack Web Developer 
                because I really enjoy Web Development. If you have any questions for me please feel free to reach out to me, contact information is below!
